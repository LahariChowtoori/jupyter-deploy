# Details

## Networking

The template places the EC2 instance in the first subnet of the default VPC in the selected AWS region, or optionally in the subnet mapping to the zone you select with the `availability_zone` variable. The template assigns an Elastic IP (EIP) to the instance to keep its public IP address stable across stop/start cycles.

Amazon Route 53 manages DNS. The template references a Hosted Zone for your domain (which must already exist) and adds a DNS record pointing your subdomain to the instance's Elastic IP.

The instance's security group only allows ingress on port 443 (HTTPS). There is no SSH access — all administrator operations go through AWS Systems Manager (SSM).

## Compute

The template selects the latest Amazon Linux 2023 AMI compatible with the chosen instance type:
- Standard AL2023 AMI for CPU instances (x86_64 or arm64)
- Deep Learning AMI (DLAMI) for GPU or Neuron instances (x86_64 or arm64)

You can also provide a specific AMI ID to override automatic selection.

## Storage

The instance has two volumes. The root volume inherits its size and settings from the selected AMI, with a configurable minimum size. It persists across instance restarts and instance type changes, as long as the new instance type is compatible with the existing root volume. The template attaches a separate EBS data volume and mounts it into the **JupyterLab** container at `/home/jovyan` — this volume persists user data across container restarts and instance stop/start cycles.

You can optionally attach additional EBS volumes or EFS file systems and mount them into the Jupyter home directory.

EBS volumes cannot cross availability zones, so changing `availability_zone` on a live deployment replaces them. Back them up with `jd volume backup` and restore them with `jd config --restore-volumes` first — see the `AGENT.md` in your project directory for the full sequence. EFS file systems are regional and need none of this.

## TLS

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) provides TLS certificates using the [ACME](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555) protocol. Traefik acts as the ACME client and proves domain ownership via a [DNS-01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge): it creates a temporary TXT record in the Route 53 Hosted Zone, Let's Encrypt verifies it, and issues the certificate. Traefik stores the certificate in `acme.json` and renews it automatically. The template also backs the certificate up to AWS Secrets Manager so it persists across instance replacements.

## IAM and Secrets

The template creates an IAM role for the EC2 instance with permissions for SSM, Route 53, S3, and (optionally) EFS access.

The template creates two AWS Secrets Manager secrets:
- One to store the OAuth App client secret
- One to store TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt, ensuring they persist across instance replacements

## Deployment Configuration

An S3 bucket stores all deployment configuration files: bash scripts, Docker service definitions, and application configuration. The instance pulls these files during setup or updates via a cloud-init script.

The template creates an SSM startup document that orchestrates instance configuration using these files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cloudinit.sh.tftpl` | EC2 instance configuration |
| `docker-compose.yml.tftpl` | Docker service definitions |
| `docker-startup.sh.tftpl` | Docker service startup |
| `cloudinit-volumes.sh.tftpl` | Optional EBS/EFS volume mounts |
| `traefik.yml.tftpl` | Traefik reverse proxy configuration |
| `dockerfile.jupyter` | Jupyter container image |
| `jupyter-start.sh` | Jupyter container entrypoint |
| `jupyter-reset.sh` | Fallback if Jupyter fails to start |
| `pyproject.jupyter.toml` | Python dependencies for the Jupyter environment |
| `jupyter_server_config.py` | Jupyter server settings |
| `dockerfile.logrotator` | Log rotation sidecar container |
| `logrotator-start.sh.tftpl` | Logrotate configuration |
| `fluent-bit.conf` | Fluent-bit log collection configuration |
| `parsers.conf` | Fluent-bit Docker log parsers |

If you selected `pixi` as the dependency manager, the template uses `pixi.jupyter.toml` instead of `pyproject.jupyter.toml`.

An SSM association triggers the startup script on the instance whenever the configuration changes.

## Operations

The template creates SSM documents that the `jd` CLI uses to manage the deployment remotely:

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `check-status-internal.sh` | Verify services are running and TLS certificates are available |
| `get-status.sh` | Translate status checks to human-readable output |
| `update-auth.sh` | Update authorized org, teams, and/or users |
| `get-auth.sh` | Retrieve current authorization settings |
| `update-server.sh` | Update running services |
| `refresh-oauth-cookie.sh` | Rotate the OAuth cookie secret and invalidate all sessions |

## Logging

Fluent-bit collects Docker service logs and writes them to `/var/log/services` on the instance volume. A logrotate sidecar container handles automatic rotation of all log files based on configurable size and retention settings.

## Presets

The template provides two variable presets:
- **`defaults-all.tfvars`** — comprehensive preset with all recommended values
- **`defaults-base.tfvars`** — minimal preset that prompts for instance type and volume size
