"""E2E tests for `jd volume` against the home volume — non-mutating.

Everything here operates on the volume the template always creates, and reaches it WITHOUT --name:
the default is the first entry of the manifest's ``volumes.static`` list, and asserting that the
default resolves to the home volume is a large part of the point. A user inspecting their notebook
storage should not have to know an identity to do it.

Commands are issued inline rather than through local helpers, so each test reads as the thing it is
testing. The two plugin helpers (``get_volume_names`` / ``get_volume_details``) appear only where a
volume's state is a *precondition* — never in the `list` and `show` tests themselves, which would
otherwise assert that a helper agrees with itself.

Non-mutating in the sense the suite means it: no `jd config`, no `jd up`, no instance replacement.
``test_volume_backup_*`` does create a real EBS snapshot and needs a stopped host, which is a cloud
side effect but not a change to the deployment — and only ever one snapshot, since each backup
supersedes the previous one. The destroy-time reaper removes the last one.

Deliberately elsewhere:
  - the additional EBS/EFS mounts, and the zone swap they exist to protect, need a `jd up` to
    provision — see ``test_volume_swaps.py``.
  - file-system semantics of the home volume itself are ``test_home_volume.py``.
