    reconstruct one from a bool.

    The property this establishes is that nothing can have been written to the instance's volumes since
    the earliest of those instants -- a volume cannot change while the instance mounting it is stopped.
    It is the only provable no-data-loss condition available: EBS exposes no last-write timestamp, and a

    useless; a month-old backup of an untouched volume is perfect).

    An unknown stop time raises too. EC2 does not always report one, and for an operation that destroys
    data "cannot establish" must resolve the same way as "not quiesced" -- never as a pass.

    The comparison is strict: EC2 reports the stop to the second, so an instant equal to it cannot be
